## News

### 1.91.1 (30.06.2020)

There is a new field for additional diagram info ("Zus√§tzliche Diagramminfo"). It could be filled with a string or 
identifiers for diagram options. The option identifiers have this format: 

```
${Option."OptionName"} e. g. for option VERSION_TAG (value "4711") it would be: ${Option.VERSION_TAG}

For the option above the string "Version Tag is: ${Option."OptionName"}" leads to "Version Tag is: 4711". 
```

The new field is printed in the header block of the diagram view directly following the version date. It has been added
to allow printing option values to the diagram.
